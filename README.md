The Linear Regression model developed using the dataset of customers purchasing clothes online demonstrates a reliable performance in predicting the yearly amount spent by each customer. 
Key features such as time on the app, time on the website, average session length, and length of membership contribute significantly to the model’s predictions. 
From EDA we came to know that length of membership is highly corelated to customers yearly amount spent.
The model’s mean squared error (MSE) and root mean square error (RMSE) values indicate a reasonable fit, while the residuals are approximately normally distributed, suggesting that the model is well-calibrated. However, there is room for improvement in reducing prediction errors further, especially for certain outliers. 
Overall, this model predicts customer yearly amount spend. apart from this, the model can offers valuable insights into customer behavior and spending patterns, which could be leveraged to optimize marketing strategies and enhance customer experience in future iterations
